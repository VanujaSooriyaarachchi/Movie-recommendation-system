            "A skilled thief, Dom Cobb, specializes in extracting valuable
            secrets from vulnerable minds using dream-sharing technology.
            However, he is presented with a challenging mission: to plant an
            idea in a CEO's mind. Cobb's troubled past jeopardizes the project
            and his team. Despite being a renowned player in corporate
            espionage, he is an international fugitive who has lost everything.
            Redemption lies in one final job: inception. Instead of stealing,
            Cobb's team must accomplish the impossible by implanting an idea.
            Success would be the perfect crime, but an unpredictable enemy,
            known only to Cobb, poses a constant threat."
